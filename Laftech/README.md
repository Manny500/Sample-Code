About Us
We are Will Dixon, Conrad Stoerker, and Manuel Tenorio, Lafayette College Computer Science Seniors who are taking CS:470 Senior Project. The following is our plan for the work necessary and sufficient to complete this course.

Project Description
This document describes the source data and procedures used to prepare the data sets available on the database Inferno. The database was created on a request from the United Way organization. United Way is a leadership organization operating in more than 43 countries and territories around the world. United Way aims to create opportunities for a better life by focusing on education, income and health. As our client United Way has asked the Lafayette College CS 470: Senior Project class to build a database capable of integrating different data files relating to education data. The education data may vary in content, however, in general they will consist of different metrics assessing a school's performance, along with identification markers of the group of students such as ethnicity and grade level. The data is anonymous, there are no set identification markers that could be used to identify a student in real life. No individual student-level data is included in the database.

Objectives
	Primary
Our initial objective involves the collation of the various databases from CS320 in order to create a normalized PostgreSQL database. Following this we intend to create a tool with which the United Way can access this data in a non-technical manner. This tool will most likely take the form of a web application. The exact software/framework that will be used for this application is subject to discussion. This application will provide an interface by which the information contained within the database may be viewed. Furthermore, this application will provide basic visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs. The goal will be to provide an application that serves the Pennsylvania educational data in a convenient and easily accessible manner. 

Our goals will be reached through weekly meetings and regular status updates with the client, any issues or concerns will be addressed as quickly as possible once they are brought to our attention.
	Secondary
Upon completion of the primary objectives, our goal will be to augment the tool to produce more advanced data visualizations. We are specifically interested in the creation of a statewide choropleth heatmap. Beyond this, we find that the creation of a mechanism by which additional data may be automatically added to our database. At the very least, this tool should simplify this process.
